## Intersections
![Intersections](ManualImages/Extra/SS6-640.jpg)
- Dynamic Procedurally generated based upon lanes, road width and angle of attack.
- Turn lanes Complete left and right optional turn lanes.
- Traffic lights Fully functioning and heavily detailed traffic light system including left on yield and right turn lane only lights.
- Assets Includes several assets such as traffic light poles, street lights, traffic lights, stop signs and more. Most include rigid body versions for dynamic environments.

## Bridges
![Bridges](ManualImages/Extra/SS4-640.jpg)
- Bridge wizard Allows for instant creation of professional quality bridges such as causeway, arch, suspension and more. All bridge creation aspects are generated instantly allowing quick iteration.
- Customization Custom extrusion allows for mix and match of bridge parts. Over 50 bridge parts included.
- Details Many different types of railing, bases, center dividers included.
- Curvature Curvature of bridges supported including arch and suspension bridges.

## Railing and extrusions
![Railing](ManualImages/Extra/SS5-640.jpg)
- Railing 12+ Railing types included such as K-Rails and W Beams.
- Center dividers Many center divider options including the most popular configurations such as K-Rails with blinders or street lights. All aspects of mesh extrusion are performed instantly allowing quick iteration.
- Collision barriers Water barrels and other collision barriers come with prefabricated rigid or static body configurations.
- Custom extrusion Extrude any custom mesh along the spline with almost limitless customization.

## Assets
![Assets](ManualImages/Extra/SS3-640.jpg)
- Road assets several road assets included such as street lights, double lights, stop signs and more. All aspects of road asset placement are done instantly, allowing for quick iterations.
- Custom assets Place any custom mesh along the spline with an extreme amount of customization options.
- Signs 300+ U.S. federal and state road signs are pre-built and available for use.
- Future assets Assets will be added and freely available as time progresses.

## Quality
![Quality](ManualImages/Extra/SS2-640.jpg)
- Speed All mesh extrusion, bridge extrusion and road asset placement actions are instantaneous. Optimized road generation results in an average 100ms per (2km road + 1 intersection). Multithreaded support.
- Quality Most road textures at least 1024x1024 resolution. Most materials include normal and specular maps. Most assets created to federal or state specification.
